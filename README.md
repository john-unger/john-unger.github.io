This is responsible for rendering my personal page

### Deployment
GHA are set in place such that any contribution to `main` will trigger a build optimized for production deployments (which is committed to `gh-pages`) and what then GitHub hosts

### Dev Notes:
- run `npm start` as that will continually keep track of what is needed to render, including keeping tailwind and daisyUI up-to-date.
